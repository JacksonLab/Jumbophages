# Jumbophages
Data and analysis scripts from Malone et al., 2019: A nucleus-forming jumbophage evades CRISPR-Cas DNA targeting but is vulnerable to type III RNA-based immunity

Spacer-protospacer matches identified by GASSST (target_search.sh) were processed using Jumbo_project_Spacer_hit_analysis_Workflow_type(IE/IF or III).R then the outputs were merged and analysed using Jumbo_project_Spacer_hit_analysis_Workflow_all.R
